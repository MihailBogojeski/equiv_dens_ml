# One watchdog for the whole water/OOD labelling campaign.
#
# The campaign is 15 arrays across 10 splits and 2 levels of theory, spread over
# a 4 h small tier and a 24 h large tier. Running 15 separate watchdogs would
# mean 15 processes to keep alive; instead this walks every shard directory that
# exists, re-submits only the shards still outstanding in each, and sleeps.
#
# Splits are discovered from the shard tree rather than listed here, so a split
# added later by launch_water_campaign.sh is picked up with no edit.
#
# Usage:  scripts/revision/watch_water_campaign.sh [INTERVAL_S]
